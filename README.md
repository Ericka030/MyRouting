# MyRouting - Custom SDN Routing Module

## Overview
MyRouting is a **custom routing application** built for the Floodlight SDN Controller.  
It handles OpenFlow-enabled switches by processing packet events, computing shortest paths,  
and dynamically installing flow rules in a software-defined network.

---

## Features
- Implements **shortest-path routing algorithms** using priority queues and hash maps.  
- Handles `PacketIn` events to install flow rules across network switches.  
- Integrates with **OpenFlow APIs (OFFlowMod, OFMatch, OFActionOutput)**.  
- Designed for **scalability and fault tolerance** in distributed networks.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Frameworks:** Floodlight SDN Controller  
- **Protocols:** OpenFlow  
- **Concepts:** Networking, Graph Algorithms, Systems Programming  

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Networking & routing protocols  
- Distributed systems & concurrency  
- Systems programming in Java  
- Algorithm implementation (graph/shortest path)  
- Documentation & version control (Git)
